- 👋 Hi, I’m @siriushp0904
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code. I am a beginner, but I am hoping to learn efficient webscraping and potentially design a working API.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...I'm not sure I have enough experience to truly collaborate, but I wouldn't mind if someone wanted to give me more basic tasks as a way for me to learn and a way for them to not have to do more of the repetitive "easy work".
- 📫 How to reach me discord is probably the best. siriushp094#4093
